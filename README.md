# Destiny Weapons Comparison

Compare any weapon from the game Destiny directly from their API. No database storage. No further dependencies. Just pure Ruby!

_Currently Destiny Weapons Comparison is in Brazilian Portuguese only and doesn't suport internationalization. But I'll get there soon!_

## Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 5.0 or higher;
* And that's all!

## Installing

* Clone the repository into your machine;
* Run `gem install` to install all RoR dependencies;
* Open the file `config/initializers/destiny_api.rb` and insert your Bungie API key;
* Open Terminal, run `rails s` and in your browser go to `http://localhost:3000`;
* Everything should be working fine!
